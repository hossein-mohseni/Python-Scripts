This repository contains my Python projects for my university course with Professor Minoofam. The projects are split into two parts.

## Part 1: Calculation 📊
In this part, I used Python to analyze various datasets. The projects include:

🌡️ [Temperature Converter](https://github.com/hossein-mohseni/Python-Scripts/blob/main/Part1%20%F0%9F%91%81%EF%B8%8F/Temperature-Converter.py): A program that converts Celsius temperature into Fahrenheit temperature.

📏 [Cylinder Volume Calculator](https://github.com/hossein-mohseni/Python-Scripts/blob/main/Part1%20%F0%9F%91%81%EF%B8%8F/Cylinder-Volume-Calculator.py): A program that calculates the volume of a cylinder using the radius and length input.

🔢 [Exponent Calculator](https://github.com/hossein-mohseni/Python-Scripts/blob/main/Part1%20%F0%9F%91%81%EF%B8%8F/Exponent-Calculator.py): A program that calculates exponents with two lists of base and exponents input.

💰 [Gratuity and Total Calculator](https://github.com/hossein-mohseni/Python-Scripts/blob/main/Part1%20%F0%9F%91%81%EF%B8%8F/Gratuity-and-Total-Calculator.py): A program that calculates the gratuity and total based on the subtotal and gratuity rate input.

💰 [Initial Deposit Calculator](https://github.com/hossein-mohseni/Python-Scripts/blob/main/Part1%20%F0%9F%91%81%EF%B8%8F/Initial-Deposit-Calculator.py): A program that calculates the initial deposit value based on the final account value, annual interest rate, and number of years input.

🕰️ [Minutes to Years Calculator](https://github.com/hossein-mohseni/Python-Scripts/blob/main/Part1%20%F0%9F%91%81%EF%B8%8F/Minutes-to-Years-Calculator.py): A program that calculates the number of years and days based on the entered amount of minutes.

🔢 [Sum of Digits Calculator](https://github.com/hossein-mohseni/Python-Scripts/blob/main/Part1%20%F0%9F%91%81%EF%B8%8F/Sum-of-Digits-Calculator.py): A program that calculates the sum of digits of an integer input.


## Part 2: Calculation & Generators 🤖
In this part, I created various programs utilizing machine learning algorithms to solve different problems. The projects include:

📐 [Pentagon-Area-Calculator](https://github.com/hossein-mohseni/Python-Scripts/blob/main/Part2%20%F0%9F%91%80/Pentagon-Area-Calculator.py): A program that calculates the area of a regular pentagon given the length of one side.

🔢 [ASCII Converter](https://github.com/hossein-mohseni/Python-Scripts/blob/main/Part2%20%F0%9F%91%80/ASCII-Converter.py): A program that converts a number input to its corresponding ASCII character.

🌐 [Great Circle Distance Calculator](https://github.com/hossein-mohseni/Python-Scripts/blob/main/Part2%20%F0%9F%91%80/Great%20Circle-Distance-Calculator.py): A program that calculates the distance between two points represented by their latitude and longitude coordinates.

🔠 [Random Uppercase Letter Generator](https://github.com/hossein-mohseni/Python-Scripts/blob/main/Part2%20%F0%9F%91%80/Letter-Generator.py): A program that generates a random uppercase letter.

💰 [Payroll Statement](https://github.com/hossein-mohseni/Python-Scripts/blob/main/Part2%20%F0%9F%91%80/Payroll-Statement.py): A program that calculates the payroll information of an employee based on their input information.

I had a great time working on these projects and learned a lot about Python and Calculating with Python 🐍. Hope you enjoy exploring this repository! 😄
