This repository contains my Python projects for my university course with Professor Minoofam. The projects are split into two parts.

## Part 1: Calculation 📊
In this part, I used Python to analyze various datasets. The projects include:

🌡️ [Temperature Converter](Part1%20👁%EF%B8%8F/temperature_converter.py): A program that converts Celsius temperature into Fahrenheit temperature.

📏 [Cylinder Volume Calculator](Part1%20👁%EF%B8%8F/cylinder_volume_calculator.py): A program that calculates the volume of a cylinder using the radius and length input.

🔢 [Exponent Calculator](Part1%20👁%EF%B8%8F/exponent_calculator.py): A program that calculates exponents with two lists of base and exponents input.

💰 [Gratuity and Total Calculator](Part1%20👁%EF%B8%8F/gratuity_total_calculator.py): A program that calculates the gratuity and total based on the subtotal and gratuity rate input.

💰 [Initial Deposit Calculator](Part1%20👁%EF%B8%8F/initial_deposit_calculator.py): A program that calculates the initial deposit value based on the final account value, annual interest rate, and number of years input.

🕰️ [Minutes to Years Calculator](Part1%20👁%EF%B8%8F/minutes_to_years_calculator.py): A program that calculates the number of years and days based on the entered amount of minutes.

🔢 [Sum of Digits Calculator](Part1%20👁%EF%B8%8F/sum_of_digits_calculator.py): A program that calculates the sum of digits of an integer input.


## Part 2: Calculation & Generators 🤖
In this part, I created various programs utilizing machine learning algorithms to solve different problems. The projects include:

📈 [Stock Price Prediction](Part2%20👀/stock_price_prediction.py): A program that uses Linear Regression to predict the future stock prices of a company.

🧠 [Sentiment Analysis](Part2%20👀/sentiment_analysis.py): A program that uses Neural Networks to predict the sentiment of a given text.

🔍 [Image Classification](Part2%20👀/image_classification.py): A program that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images into different categories.

🔢 [ASCII Converter](Part2%20👀/ascii_converter.py): A program that converts a number input to its corresponding ASCII character.

🌐 [Great Circle Distance Calculator](Part2%20👀/great_circle_distance_calculator.py): A program that calculates the distance between two points represented by their latitude and longitude coordinates.

🔠 [Random Uppercase Letter Generator](Part2%20👀/random_uppercase_letter_generator.py): A program that generates a random uppercase letter.

💰 [Payroll Statement](Part2%20👀/payroll_statement.py): A program that calculates the payroll information of an employee based on their input information.

I had a great time working on these projects and learned a lot about Python and Calculating with Python 🐍. Hope you enjoy exploring this repository! 😄
